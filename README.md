# The Anatomy of Simple Reinforcement Learning
##Reinforcement Learning
It is where a decision-making system is trained to make optimal decisions
An agent acting in an environment. At every point in time, 
the agent observes the state of the environment and decides on an action that changes the state. For each such action, the agent is given a reward signal. The agentâ€™s role is to maximize the total received reward.

**In this RL_basic project,** 

I will define an environment that will give the agent random rewards for a limited number
of steps, regardless of the agent's actions. 
It is implemented in baby steps and it is perfect for a newbie in Reinforcement Learning.
More projects with advanced and efficient techniques in RL are coming!!
